# BMW Office - Natã Martins ©2024


<p>
  This project is a clone of the office web <a href="https://www.bmw.com.br/pt/index.html">BMW</a>
</p>

## Stacks
<p>
  I used for building this project, this stakc:
  <b>(React) NextJS</b>
  <b>TypeScritp</b>
  <b>Sass for web style</b>
  <b>Clean Code for organization and good code comparison</b>
  <b>Componentization</b>
</p>

<p>
  I could use Tailwind CSS for web styling,
  but I personally like using Sass a lot because I can do everything in a separate file and keep it organized. 
  But TailwindCSS is a good way to optimize coding time.
</p>

<p>
  For deploy I use Vercel.
